Whenever I sit to code my next new project or just code something for the fun of it, I never really think about what I would need to consider should I decide to refactor it later on. Then during one of my classes,
 I learnt about design patterns and they sounded interesting, even though I didn’t understand them because the language was too technical lol.

This blog post is the first in a series of design patterns and will be me sharing what I know about design patterns and how they can be used during your software development and maintenance. 
This is meant to help me and also someone out there learn what design patterns are.

Now that we have gotten past that very awkward introduction lol, let us actually look at what design patterns are in the simplest way.
